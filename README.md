Generative Text with Transformers
This project demonstrates the use of generative language models to produce human-like text using Hugging Face's transformers library. It supports generating text continuations, creative writing, or AI-based responses from a prompt using state-of-the-art models like GPT-2 and GPT-Neo.

🚀 Features
🤖 Generate text from a given prompt

✍️ Customizable output length and creativity (temperature)

🧠 Supports models like gpt2, EleutherAI/gpt-neo, and more

📜 Easy Python script or Streamlit app interface

🧪 Great for experiments, creative writing, and NLP tasks

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Hugging Face transformers

Streamlit (for optional web interface)

PyTorch or TensorFlow backend (auto-managed by transformers)

📦 Installation

pip install transformers streamlit
